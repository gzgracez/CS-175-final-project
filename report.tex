\section{Roll-A-Bunny Overview}
  For our CS 175 project, we decided to create a game called \textbf{Roll-A-Bunny} by building on what we've learned in class, and extending it to create this cross-platform game in Unity.
\subsection{Goal}
  Roll-A-Bunny is a combination of two classics: Whack-A-Mole + Roll-A-Ball. The goal of Roll-A-Bunny is to roll your player (a sphere) over all 9 bunnies while collecting as many yellow collectibles (12 in total) as possible in under 60 seconds. 
  You win if you are able to roll over all 9 bunnies and your score will be the number of collectibles you were able to collect in the process. If you are unable to roll over all 9 bunnies within 60 seconds, you will unfortunately lose the game.

  % TODO - 60 seconds?
  Throughout these 60 seconds, the bunnies will pop up and down in their respective positions on the 3 by 3 grid and the yellow collectibles will be rotating in place, scattered across the surface. 
  
\subsection{Navigation}
Your player can be controlled via the arrow keys or the WASD keys. 
There are 4 walls that enclose the 3 by 3 space and your player will be limited to this area. 

\subsection{Scoring / Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bunnies - each bunny will only appear in its designated cell on the 3 by 3 grid, and upon collision with a bunny, it will disappear and the bunny counter will be incremented by 1. 
  \item Yellow Collectibles - upon collision with a yellow collectible, the collectible will disappear and your score will be incremented by 1.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Walls}
We created 4 identical walls to enclose the bunnies and our player, so that the player does not roll off the screen.
